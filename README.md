Form Creation Application
Form Creation Application is a frontend-based form builder tool built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript .
It allows users to visually create custom forms by dragging, dropping, and configuring form fields — all within an interactive interface.

Users can edit field properties, preview the form live, and export the final design as either a JSON schema or a standalone HTML form.

Features Implemented in This Frontend Version
